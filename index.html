    <h2>Lines of Me</h2>

    <p>EEccentric, witty and sanguine, these are the words that not only I, but my friends and family use to describe me. Literature and I go well together and my love for it makes me express myself best through writing. It influences the way I love and look at other's love. I mix literature with dance and these two mixed with a little imagination brings out adventure. I have never been the ordinary thinker I love to understand different point of views so I try to feel what others feel. The sciences and mathematics were always my thing. I excelled when it came to those and it goes without saying that English was above them both. It is sad though that while growing up my way of thinking and expressing myself was always seen as obscure by family and friends and I could never seem to be properly understood. In a quest to try and fit in I seem to have lost some bits of my originality which I am just now reclaiming upon associating myself with the right persons and realizing that I was perfectly fine the way I was. I have come to realize that I may be a versatile thinker and that is why I, upon doing a trial run, acknowledged that I would do better off pursuing a degree in  Computer Science than the Marine Biology I was previously doing. I love writing too much to turn it into a career for I fear that once it does, it will be of no enjoyment and I may come to resent it. </p>
    <p>I try to combine all my interests in order to maintain balance, so my writing, dancing, exploring and love for logic to create a new and improved version of me. This is me, I am now writing new lines in a new file to redefine me while integrating a few parts of the old file and using it to make me, me again. Follow along while I add new lines to develop me.</p>

    <h2>Where Logic Meets Wonder: Why I Chose CS</h2>

    <p>Initially I had my mind set on studying to become a doctor at the University of the West Indies. It has been my life long dream (since I was eight years old). I decided, based on some advice, to apply for a program in the Faculty of Science and Technology with hopes to do a switch to the Faculty of Medical Science after completing my first year. I had a few roadblocks and in the midst of it all Computer Science came into being, I always heard horror stories relating to that program and I always told myself I would never be caught doing it. You attract what you fear isn’t that so? Look at me now completely switched from Marine Biology to Computer Science. Why? I got better grades, I was actually interested in the work being done and was always more curious so I was off researching more than I ever did with Marine. What I find funny though is that before I applied for University, I used to sign up for Hackathons and tried to complete the challenges during summer breaks and I did enjoy doing them with my friend. What I realize is that I like a challenge, I like to have a problem presented to me and brainstorm possible solutions, test them and see which actually works and is more efficient.</p>
    <p>All in all I can safely say do not let people deter you from anything because as my grandmother would always say “puss and dog no have eh same luck”. So do what your heart desires, do not be afraid to try new things. If I had continued to be afraid of doing this program solely because of other people’s experience I would have been stuck in a program that while I do love aquatic life, I would not be reaching my full potential. I feel Computer Science pushes me to do great and not to just get by. I hope to continue to excel in the field because I believe I am destined for greatness.</p>
